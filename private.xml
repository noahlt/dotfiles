  This file for KeyRemap4Macbook lets you copy and paste with mouse
  buttons 4 and 5, which on my mouse (Logitech Wireless Performance MX)
  are located on the side of the mouse.

  Note thot KeyRemap4Macbook catches keycodes before they are mapped to
  specific characters, so we have to use the KeyCode labels for QWERTY,
  even though I type in Dvorak.  So V is KeyCode::DOT, and C is KeyCode::I.
